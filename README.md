**Problem Statement**
- Customer Behaviour Analytics for Strategic Business Optimization

**Context** : Businesses increasingly rely on advanced analytics to predict customer behaviour and optimize operations. Accurately predicting whether a customer will make a purchase and estimating their annual spending allows companies to fine-tune marketing efforts, design personalized offers, and improve customer retention. However, this requires handling complex, noisy datasets, selecting the right features, and engineering new ones to capture nuanced customer behaviour.

**Objective** : The goal of this project to develop an end-to-end solution that includes:

1.A **classification model** to predict the likelihood of a customer making a purchase (Will_Purchase), using both direct and derived behavioural indicators.

2.A **regression model** to predict the annual spending (Annual_Spending) of a customer, taking into account multiple nonlinear interactions and latent patterns.

**The features available in the dataset are:**

- Age : shows Age of particular customer.
- Income : shows Income rate of customer.
- Purchases_in_Last_Month : Shows how many product has purchased in last month.
- Marital_Status : Marital satues of a customer.
- Gender	: Gender of a customer.
- Education_Level : shows customer's education
- Onilne_Activity_Level : shows the online activity levels of a customer for different months
- Days_since_Last_Purchase : shows days from last purchased product.
- Customer_Loyalty_Score 
- Income_Category : shows Income category(eg. high or low)
- Age_Income_Ratio
- Is_Young_Professional
- Online_Purchase_Tendency
- Will_Purchase
- Annual_Spending
- Product_Interest : shows customers interest in different products like groceries,electronics,etc.
